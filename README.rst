The **EOPF** is an ``"all included‚Äù`` framework for developing and using re-engineered as well as forthcoming processors.
It includes DevOps tooling, extensive documentation including applicable rules, guidelines and tutorials, traceability and release management tools,
and a software stack for development and orchestration.

The **EOPF** constitutes the foundation of re-engineered processors.
It drives how they will be implemented by software developers; how they will be used by scientists as a standalone processing solution
or in production as a cloud-ready distributed and parallelized solution using the `dask`_ library.

The **Core Python Modules (CPM)** is python package gathering the best-in-class open-source python modules in
a harmonized framework providing features such as:

   * data management
   * data conversion
   * distributed and parallel computing
   * logs and trace
   * processors triggering and workflows definition.
