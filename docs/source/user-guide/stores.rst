How to use Store and Accessors
==============================

Stores and Accessors are inherited from :obj:`eopf.product.store.EOProductStore` and provide a standard way to
access data from an :obj:`eopf.product.EOProduct`

Accessors are specific to legacy product and stores are more generic.

All the definition of the safe is stored in a file, called mapping and follow a specific format.


EOZarrStore
